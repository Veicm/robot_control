# robot_controll
This is a collection of various MicroPython programs that you can use to build your own SMARS robot.
A detailed guide for building it can be found at this link: https://bookstack.jb-net.eu/books/smars-roboter.

# configuration
The code is written for MicroPython on a Raspberry Pi Pico without a Wi-Fi module. Depending on the script, it supports the following components:
- Motors with motor drivers
- Ultrasonic sensor
- a small traffic light
- (limited) Infrared sensor
- (not mentioned on the website) Joystick

# coming soon
- An explanation of each scriptâ€™s functionality in both German and English:
- An explanation of each function in the script
- An English version of the scripts

# credits
The code is partially based on the RobotLibrary (https://github.com/marjaco/robotlibrary) by @marjaco(https://github.com/marjaco).
Additionally, @marjaco contributed to parts of the scripts that do not appear in the RobotLibrary in the same or a similar form.
